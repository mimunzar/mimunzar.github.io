  <h2>Hands Off LaTex Compilation</h2>

  <p>Recently I have been writing a CV in  LaTex  and  without  any  specialized
  software it pained me that I have to manually  compile  to  see  the  results.
  What can I do with it?  How can I implement a watcher which compiles code  for
  me automatically?</p>

  <p>The easy way to do  a  watcher  is  to  do  an  infinite  loop  which  will
  periodically repeats the command like so:</p>

  <pre>$ while true; do xelatex cv.tex && xelatex cv.tex; sleep 2; done</pre>

  <p>This works, my code is now compiled every 2 seconds.  What if I didn't make
  any changes?  The code still compiles.  I can solve that by putting  the  code
  into a Makefile which will refuse to compile if no change has  been  made.   I
  can then run the make in the loop instead:</p>

  <pre>
# Makefile
.PHONY: all

all: cv.pdf

cv.pdf: cv.tex
    xelatex cv.tex && xelatex cv.tex</pre>

  <pre>$ while true; do make; sleep 0.5; done</pre>

  <p>The code now compiles only when a change has been made.  I  can  also  tune
  the sleep command down a little to have it more responsive.  The message  spam
  from the make that there is nothing to be done is annoying me.  I can  improve
  the command to call make only when there is work to be done:</p>

  <pre>$ while true; do make -q || make; sleep 0.5; done</pre>

  <p>Good enough for me. I can now fully focus on my LaTex code. As a finishing
  touch I can  save  the  command  into  the  Makefile  and  simply  call  'make
  watch':</p>

  <pre>
# Makefile
.PHONY: all watch

all: cv.pdf

cv.pdf: cv.tex
    xelatex cv.tex && xelatex cv.tex

watch:
    while true; do $(MAKE) -q || $(MAKE); sleep 0.5; done</pre>

  <p>Note: I have also used this approach to auto execute  tests  and  was  very
  happy how it turned out.</p>
